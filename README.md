# Molecular-gas-probe
First, I compute the rest frequency range with observed frequency and redshift. 
H2O survey: 180344.164~184519.764MHz and 192870.964~197046.564MHz
HCN J=2-1 survey:175829.94~179787.366MHz and 187802.406~191809.926MHz

Then, I found the theoretical lines in the range of 175~197GHz from Splatalogue, saved in molecule.xcel.
